A feature selection algorithm we developed based on Social Ski Driver Optimization and Late Acceptance Hill Climbing. Our work has been published in the journal IEEE Access Volume:8.  DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988157
- Code-one.py updates the global best solution using the best particle position over the entire population.
- Code-three.py updates the global best solution by randomly choosing one out of the top three best particle positions over the entire population.
